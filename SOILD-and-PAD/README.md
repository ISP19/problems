# Answer
|SOLID Principle| PAD|
|:-------------------------------------------------|--------|
|S (Single responsibility principle) |PAD30 (Write Cohesive Code)|
|O (Open/closed principle) | - |
|L (Liskov substitution principle) |PAD32 (Substitute by Contract)
|I (Interface segregation principle)| - |
|D (Dependency inversion principle)| - |

# S, PAD30
Write cohesive code is the same as writing single responsibility code.

*Cohesion* meaning, measure of how functionally related the members of a
component. High cohesion indicates that the members work toward one feature or set of features.

# L, PAD32
Letting new code take the place of existing code without the existing code knowing the difference.
 “Any derived class
object must be substitutable wherever a base class object is used, without the need for the user to know the difference.”
