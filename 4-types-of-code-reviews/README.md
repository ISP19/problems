### Notes from Instructor

(2) the work product is not necessarily "a complex business problem"; it could be anything. In Extreme Programming (XP) pair programming is supposedly used for *everything*.

(3) as mentioned in class, everyone on a review team should have good understanding of the problem and the code being written.  Synchronous reviews are good for knowledge transfer, but its not a place to educate someone unfamiliar with the task.  Don't know why DZone wrote this, but its not correct, I think.

(4) "prevents the problem of forced context switching" does not describe the nature of asynchronous reviews.  It just means that reviewers can review when they want, so they aren't forced to attend a review meeting at an inconvenient time ("context switching").
