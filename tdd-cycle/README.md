# Test-Driven Development
  
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development practice that uses a very specific development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is written just enough that the tests pass.  

### The Three Laws of TDD

1. You may npot write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
2. You may not write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
3. You may not write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.


## Question

Order the steps in a TDD cycle.  
  
__ Run all tests and see them all succeed.  
__ Run all tests and see some of them fail.  
__ Write the code.  
__ Add a test.  

## TDD Programming Task

Run the Python unittests in `test_remove_vowel.py`. You will see that some cases fail.  
Modify the `remove_vowel` function in `remove_vowel.py` until all test cases in `test_remove_vowel.py` pass.
