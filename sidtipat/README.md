*Instructor's Note: The first answer comes from the PAD book, but I don't think it
is true anymore, since we can work on branches and in a local repository.* 

*Commit your work frequently enables you to recover from mistakes; pushing your work (on a branch) to a remote provides backup-protection against lost files.*
