In the situation below, which one of Agile (*what?*) is appropriate to solve the problem?

1. I have 3 close friends, we often form a group to do course work. One day, the teacher gave us a project. We discussed it and divided the work among everyone in the group. But one of my friends can’t do his/her work, another friend blame him/her. I think it’s not good enough for people to fight about over this problem. So I think I might use ……………………………………… which is the one of Agile practices to solve this.

2. I have found the new things about the python language, it’s can be replaced the old of my knowledge in the python [Eg. format string in print(f”{a}”)], then I figure it out about one of the Agile practice, ………………………………………… It’s better for me though.

3. Our project has been done for about 2 weeks, but we never ever deploy or commit anything to GitHub yet, my friends don’t know what I do, also I don’t know what my friends do too. What am I missing? I don’t know, then I ask my teacher how can I solve this problem, he say “………………………………………………………… It’s in the Agile you know?”

4. Alex is a good programmer. He always writes a code in different way from other people, the code works perfectly, but other people can’t understand the code, so I suggest the Agile ………………………………………………………… to him to improve.

5. One day in my project work, I do not know exactly the work I have to do because my friends already do my work and I don’t understand what they do, so I have to …………………………………………………… Bt the Agile practice way.
