In the situation below, which one of Agile is appropriate to solve the problem?

1. I have 3 close friends, we group up the group in every work. One day, the teacher gave us the project. We discuss this and share the work for everyone in the group. But my one of my friends can’t do his/her work, another friend blame him/her. I think it’s not good enough for people to fight about this problem. So I think I have to use ………………………………….…… which is the one of Agile practices to solve this.
2. I have found the new things about python, it’s replace the old of my knowledge in python [Eg. format string in print(f”{a}”)], then I figure it out about one of the Agile practice, ……………………………….. It’s better for me though.
3. Our project has been done for about 2 weeks, but we never ever deploy or commit to GitHub yet, my friends don’t know what I do, also I don’t know what my friends do too. What am I missing? I don’t know, then I ask my friends, they say “…………………………………….. It’s in the Agile you know????”
4. Alex is a good programmer. He always writes a code with different way than other people, the code works perfectly, but other people can’t understand the code, so I suggest the Agile ……………………………. To him for improve!!
5. One day in my project work, I do not know exactly the work I have to do because my friends already do my work and I don’t understand what they do, so I have to ……………………………….. Bt the Agile practice way.

Answer
1. Tips1 : Blame doesn’t fix bugs.
    Blaming other people can't solve the problem, it might cause the relation between people in the long term, the best way is show them how to do or what to do when the problem's happend instead of blaming.

2. Learn the new; unlearn the old.
    The new things is importance for programmer because the world has gone too far for many many years since the computer was invented. The best is find the new things and replace the old things by the better things. Many of programmer do this all the time for improving themselve.
3. Keep your project releasable at all times.
    This is important for the developer who work with other people, you have to deploy or make sure the work is ready for other people can do next or improve for avoding the bugs or problems in the future.
4. Write code to be clear, not clever
    The good code is easy code for other people who work with you. If the code is smart but other people can't get them immediately, the code isn't good enough. So try to write for other people can understand is the best way to code.
5. Use stand-up meetings
    This is important for working with group of people, the way that can tell or let others know what we do or what ourselve do lately. Because something have to wait for abother one to be done first, so the people who wait for that thing will know and can do the next task.
