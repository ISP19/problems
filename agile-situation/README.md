In the situation below, which one of Agile is appropriate to solve the problem?

1. I have 3 close friends, we often form a group to do course work. One day, the teacher gave us a project. We discussed it and divided the work among everyone in the group. But one of my friends can’t do his/her work, another friend blame him/her. I think it’s not good enough for people to fight about over this problem. So I think I might use ……………………………………… which is the one of Agile practices to solve this.

2. I have found the new things about the python language, it’s can be replaced the old of my knowledge in the python [Eg. format string in print(f”{a}”)], then I figure it out about one of the Agile practice, ………………………………………… It’s better for me though.

3. Our project has been done for about 2 weeks, but we never ever deploy or commit anything to GitHub yet, my friends don’t know what I do, also I don’t know what my friends do too. What am I missing? I don’t know, then I ask my teacher how can I solve this problem, he say “………………………………………………………… It’s in the Agile you know????”

4. Alex is a good programmer. He always writes a code in different way from other people, the code works perfectly, but other people can’t understand the code, so I suggest the Agile ………………………………………………………… to him to improve.

5. One day in my project work, I do not know exactly the work I have to do because my friends already do my work and I don’t understand what they do, so I have to …………………………………………………… Bt the Agile practice way.

    This is important for the developer who work with other people, you have to deploy or make sure the work is ready for other people can do next or improve for avoding the bugs or problems in the future.

4. Tips25 - Write code to be clear, not clever <br/>
    The good code is easy code for other people who work with you. If the code is smart but other people can't get them immediately, the code isn't good enough. So try to write for other people can understand is the best way to code.

5. Tips38 - Use stand-up meetings <br/>
    This is important for working with group of people, the way that can tell or let others know what we do or what ourselve do lately. Because something have to wait for abother one to be done first, so the people who wait for that thing will know and can do the next task.
