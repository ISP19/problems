# increment and daylog

## Question :

> Why should we choose to implement code with increment coding rather than long term coding, Give a reason upon your answer.

> Explain what is the importance of “Keep a solution log” and process of its?

## Answer :

1) According to PAD tips 28 implementing increment coding, your code will be much easier to maintain. Because using short term coding allow you to detect bugs and error easier than other method

2) According to PAD tips 33, keeping a solution log can improve efficiency and reduce the time being wasted by making a note on how to solve this problem. Next time, when you find the problem, you can solve it right away instead of finding the solution yourself on the internet, either by StackOverflow or other sites which can be a very time-consuming procedure.
