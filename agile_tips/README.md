# Question #
In my project, I have three people in my team and now we cannot work on the plan because we didn’t ever work with before and now someone in my team didn’t work on time that we set it on before. Now I want to bring Practices of an Agile Developer to fix this problem but I didn’t know that it still works at this time. So can you tell me why it can work or not work at this time and if its work can you show some 2-3 tips that can help me at this time and why I should use it? 


## Answer ##
**Ans** Yes it can work because in tips it tells how to fix or improve your team to work well why you still working on your projects    
**4. Do what’s right.** Be honest, and have the courage to communicate the truth. It may be difficult at times; that’s why it takes courage. It makes you have some difficult time when you have to talk about some problems with people that you didn’t close too but it can make your work go flow more than the past .  
**23. Measure how much work is left.** Don’t kid yourself—or your team—with irrelevant metrics. Measure the backlog of work to do. You should change focus from your team to focus on your backlog and measure what things left to do and you have to manage from your team performance.
