Kanban vs. Scrum
===
**Kanban: Continuous improvement, flexible processes** <br />
Kanban is an agile methodology that is not necessarily iterative. Processes are similar to Scrum, which have short iterations. It imitating a project lifecycle on a small scale by having a distinct beginning and ending for each iteration. Kanban allows the software be developed in one large development cycle.

**Delivery Timelines**: Kanban is based on a continuous workflow structure that keeps teams nimble and ready to adapt to changing priorities

**Release methodology**: In kanban, updates are released whenever they are ready, without a regular schedule or predetermined due dates.

**Roles**: There are no pre-defined roles for a team. Although there may still be a Project Manager. The whole team owns the kanban board. Some teams enlist an agile coach but, unlike scrum, there is no single “kanban master” who keeps everything running smoothly.

**Key metrics**: Measures production using Lead time, Cycle time, and Work In Progress (WIP) limits time or the amount of time it takes to complete one full piece of a project from beginning to end.

**Change philosophy**: A kanban workflow can change at any time. New work items can get added to the backlog and existing cards can get blocked or removed all together based on prioritization.

**Delegation & Prioritization**: Uses a "pull system" or a systematic workflow that allows team members to only pull new tasks once the previous task is complete.

|---------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|Delivery Timelines         |Continuous workflow             |Regular fixed length sprints (ie, 2 weeks)     |
|Release methodology        |Continuous delivery             |At the end of each sprint                      |
|Roles                      |No required roles               |Product owner, scrum master, development team  |
|Key metrics                |Lead time, Cycle time, WIP or the amount of time it takes to complete a project from beginning to end      |Velocity                                       |
|Change philosophy          |Change can happen at any time   |Teams should not make changes during the sprint|
|Best Applications          |Projects with varying priorities|Teams with stable priorities                   |
|Delegation & Prioritization|Allows team members to only pull new tasks once the previous task is complete|An entire batch is pulled for each iteration|
