Kanban vs. Scrum
===
**Kanban: Continuous improvement, flexible processes** <br />
Kanban is all about visualizing your work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing efficiency(or flow). Kanban teams focus on reducing the time it takes to take a project(or user story) from start to finish. They do this by using a kanban board and continuously improving their flow of work. 

**Kanban cadence**: Kanban is based on a continuous workflow structure that keeps teams nimble and ready to adapt to changing priorities

**Release methodology**: In kanban, updates are released whenever they are ready, without a regular schedule or predetermined due dates.

**Roles**: The whole team owns the kanban board. Some teams enlist an agile coach but, unlike scrum, there is no single “kanban master” who keeps everything running smoothly.

**Key metrics**: Lead time, cycle, and Work In Progress(WIP) limits time are important metrics for kanban teams.

**Change philosophy**: A kanban workflow can change at any time. New work items can get added to the backlog and existing cards can get blocked or removed all together based on prioritization.
