### **Question**
1. What should we use to maintain the original behavior of the system? why?

2. Refactoring starts with code that already exists and we change or improve as needed. How does rewriting work?

3. What can be done during the development process? why?

4. If we want to improve or maintain both the old system and the new system at the same time what should we use?


### **Answer**
1. Refactoring because rewrite will change the original behavior of the system and may cause a very bad problem.

2. Rewrite starts with code that not exists, for replaces the system that we want.

3. Refactoring because refactoring does not correlation or association with the deployment so, it will not affect.

4. Refactoring
