**Delivery Timelines**: Kanban is based on a continuous workflow structure which products and processes delivered continuously. These will keeps team members ready to adapt to changing.

**Release methodology**: There is no fixed time to deliver a task. The tasks or updates of each task are released whenever in ready status.

**Roles**: There are no fixed roles for a team. The whole team owns the Kanban board (one of the tools can be used to manage the flow of work).

**Measurement of productivity**: Measures production using Lead time, Cycle time, and Work In Progress (WIP) limits the time, Which focusing on the amount of time it takes to complete a project from beginning to ending.

**Change philosophy**: Change can happen at any time. New tasks can be added to the backlog and old tasks can get removed based on prioritization.

**Delegation & Prioritization**: Uses a pull system which means tasks are pulled from the Kanban board by team members after the previous task is complete.
